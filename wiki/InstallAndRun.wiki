= Introduction =
The code base includes a number of example applications. For MS Surface, there are two applications which utilize non-anonymous user interaction, and for Android there is an example of how to implement a custom user authentication mechanism with a customized UI. How to install and run the three applications are described in the following.

= MS Surface =
There are two example applications available for the MS Surface, "Warm-up" and "Restaurant". They have been used during conduction of a user evaluation as part of the thesis writing.

Both applications are ready to run once compiled. They both use the default user authentication mechanism in the NAI framework. 

== Warm-up ==
This application demonstrates some of the features in the NAI Framework. The screenshot below shows the application running with three smartphone clients.

== Restaurant ==
The application is an order and payment system for the restaurant of the future. It is an example of deployment of the NAI framework in a familiar and realistic scenario. The screenshot below shows the first state of the application, where two restaurant guests order food and beverages with their smartphones.
